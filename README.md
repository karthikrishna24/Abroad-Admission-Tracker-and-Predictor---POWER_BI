# Abroad Admission Tracker and Predictor | POWER BI

## Introduction
My target audience for this dashboard will be, Students who are willing to get into foreign universities. The end goal of this project is to make an interactive dashboard for the willing students to get to know about the minimum marks required, min SOP, LOR points required, and all the other criteria for their desired university. Apart from a normal dashboard, I integrated an Admission predictor feature With this dashboard, you can predict your chances of getting admitted to a foreign university. All you have to do is input the required information using sliders, and the dashboard will use a trained ML model to calculate your probability & chance of admission (See the video to know more, link - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/karthikrishnasuriya_powerbi-education-visualization-activity-7074606706470621184-z0It?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

## Insights
1.) From the KPIs, cutoff marks for separate features can be obtained, i.e., the minimum required marks for more chance of admission.

2.) The three column charts show the minimum scores required to get admitted to universities across different university ratings, as well as the variance of scores among the university ratings. The first chart shows CGPA, the second shows GRE scores, and the third shows TOEFL scores.

3.) From the pie chart, the percentage of distribution of chances of admission can be observed.

4.) From the first scatter plot (GRE Score vs CGPA), allows us to observe patterns between GRE scores, CGPA, and the corresponding chances of admission. From this, the required CGPA and GRE Score can be obtained by a student.

5.) From the second scatter plot (TOEFL Score vs CGPA), allows us to observe patterns between TOEFL scores, CGPA, and the corresponding chances of admission. From this, the required CGPA and TOEFL Score can be obtained by a student.

6.) From the clustered column chart, we can observe the distribution of students who got admitted and those who did not, based on the criteria of whether they have done research or not.

7.) From the first stacked column chart, we can observe the percentage distribution of chance of admission among the LOR Rating. From this required LOR rating for admission can be obtained.

8. ) From the second stacked column chart, we can observe the percentage distribution of chance of admission among the SOP ratings. From this required SOP rating for admission can be obtained.
